### i.
In short, the Integration Manager workflow utilizes centralized
integration and the Director and Lieutenants workflow utilized
distributed integration. In the Integration Manager workflow, all of the
integration conflict resolution is done by a singular integration
manager who then pushes changes to the blessed repository; whereas, in
the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow, each lieutenant merges changes
for his/her developers and resolves any arising integration conflicts
before pushing the changes to the dictator's repository who, in turn,
resolves any arising integration conflicts from all of the lieutenants'
pushes before pushing to the blessed repository.
